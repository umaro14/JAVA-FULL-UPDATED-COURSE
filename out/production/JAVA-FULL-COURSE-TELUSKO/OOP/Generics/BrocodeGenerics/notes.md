# Generics in Java
    ==> allow you to create classes, methods, and interfaces that can work with different data types while providing:

# ⭐ 1. Type Safety

You catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

# ⭐ 2. No Need for Casting

You don’t need to cast objects when retrieving them.

# ⭐ 3. Reusability

One class/method can work with many data types.

Its benefit is to eliminate the need to create multiple versions of method or classes for various data types.
# USE ONE VERSION FOR ALL REFERENCE DATA TYPES.
